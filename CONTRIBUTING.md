I'm learning to work with Svelte on this project, and I'm using it to practice setting up an application and identifying trade-offs. I'm sure there are better ways to do may things in this code and I'd love to hear your thoughts if you mind sharing them!

Opening an issue is a good way to get in touch, but if you're not a Github user, writing to `hello@memorablewords.org` is a good way too.
